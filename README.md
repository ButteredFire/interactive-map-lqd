# Description
This is an interactive map reserved for Lê Quý Đôn High School for the Gifted. It is just my personal project.

# Purpose
The program, designed with an intuitive UI in mind, provides assistance in helping students navigate the 1km<sup>2</sup> campus with detailed statistics and 3D renders of each and every facility.

# Phases
✅ Phase 1: Create UI and use a 2D map as a placeholder (Map on left, statistics panel on right).

✅ Phase 2: Create a database of "hotspots" including detailed statistics and display them on the right panel.

Phase 3: Replace 2D map with a 3D one.

Phase 4: Vietnamese localization.

Phase 5: Finalize program and fix any bugs.

Final Phase: Build/Package Electron application and generate executable files.
